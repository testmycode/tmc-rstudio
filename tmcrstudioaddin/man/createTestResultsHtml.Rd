\usage{
createTestResultsHtml(testResults, showAll)
}
\arguments{
\item{testResults}{List of test results.}

\item{showAll}{Boolean for showing all test results.}
}
\value{
A single \code{Shiny} \code{HTML} tag object containing all
of the elements in the created \code{HTML} test result output.
}
\description{
Create \code{HTML} for displaying test results.
}
\details{
The created \code{HTML} includes a percentage bar for
showing how many of the tests passed, and a list of paragraph
elements for each of the test results. If the user has ticked off the
\code{Show all results} checkbox, then instead of a list only a
single paragraph element is shown. The single parahraph is either of
the first failing test, or a message showing "All tests passed" if
none of the tests failed. If the current exercise doesn't have any
tests associated with it, then only a single paragraph reading "No
tests for exercise" is returned.
